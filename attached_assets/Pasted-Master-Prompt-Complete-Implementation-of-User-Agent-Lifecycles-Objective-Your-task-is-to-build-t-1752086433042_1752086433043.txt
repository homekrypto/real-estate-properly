Master Prompt: Complete Implementation of User & Agent Lifecycles
Objective:
Your task is to build the complete, end-to-end user experience for the two primary roles on www.real-estate-properly.com: Property Seekers (Users) and Real Estate Agents (Paying Customers). This involves creating all necessary pages, forms, logic, payment integration, and dashboards to support the full lifecycle for each role.
Phase I: The Standard User (Seeker) Lifecycle
This phase focuses on the journey of a user looking for property.
Registration:
Create a dedicated "Sign Up" page or modal.
The form must require: Full Name, Email Address, and Password (with confirmation).
Upon submission, a user account is created in the database with the role set to seeker.
Crucially: The system must trigger a (simulated) email verification email to the user's address containing a unique verification link. The account remains in an "unverified" state.
Email Verification:
When the user clicks the link from their email, they are taken to a page that says "Your account has been successfully verified! You can now log in."
The user's status in the database is updated to "verified."
Login:
Create a "Login" page or modal.
The form requires Email Address and Password.
A "Forgot Password" link must be present, which initiates a password reset flow.
Upon successful login, the user is redirected to the homepage, and the header now shows "Dashboard" and "Logout" buttons.
Phase II: The Professional Agent Lifecycle (The Business Core)
This is the complete monetization flow for agents.
Agent Registration:
The "Sign Up" process must have a clear option or a separate page for "I am a Real Estate Agent."
The Agent registration form requires additional fields: Agency Name and Phone Number.
Upon submission, an account is created with the role set to agent and an "unverified" status, triggering the same email verification flow as in Phase I.
The Pricing & Onboarding Flow:
After an agent verifies their email and logs in for the first time, they must be redirected to the Pricing Page. They cannot access the dashboard until they subscribe.
The Pricing Page must display the following three packages as interactive cards:
Bronze: 10 Properties, $40/mo.
Silver: 25 Properties, $60/mo.
Gold: 35 Properties, $80/mo.
Each card must clearly display a toggle or text showing the annual savings: "Save 10% by paying for the whole year."
Each card will have a "Choose Plan" button.
Stripe Checkout Integration:
When an agent clicks "Choose Plan," they must be redirected to a Stripe Checkout session.
The Stripe session must be pre-filled with the correct plan details (e.g., "Gold Plan - Annual Subscription").
After a successful payment, Stripe must notify our application (via webhook/callback), and the user must be automatically redirected back to their new Agent Dashboard.
Phase III: The Agent Dashboard & Property Management
This is the agent's primary workspace after subscribing. Create this dashboard from scratch.
Dashboard Structure:
The dashboard must have a clear navigation menu (e.g., a sidebar) with links to: My Properties, Add New Property, and Subscription.
Subscription Management:
The "Subscription" page must display the agent's current plan (e.g., "You are on the Gold Plan").
It should show the next renewal date and a button to "Manage Billing," which links to the Stripe customer portal.
Property Management & Feature Gating:
The "My Properties" page will display a table of the agent's current listings. Each row will show the property photo, address, price, and status (e.g., Active, Draft).
Each row must have "Edit" and "Delete" buttons.
CRITICAL: The system must enforce the plan limit. If an agent on the Gold plan has 35 active listings, the "Add New Property" button must be disabled or show a message prompting them to upgrade or contact support.
Property Creation Form & Final Output:
The "Add New Property" link leads to a comprehensive creation form. This form is the core of the agent's work.
The form must contain all necessary fields to generate a public listing identical in detail to this example: https://www.properstar.com/listing/101827785.
This includes (but is not limited to) fields for:
Basic Info: Title, Buy/Rent, Price, Full Address (Street, City, Country).
Property Details: Type (Villa, Apartment), Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Living Area (sq ft or mÂ²), Plot Area, Year Built, Floor Level.
Media: A multi-image uploader.
Text: A rich-text editor for the main description.
Features: A checklist of amenities (Pool, Garage, Balcony, Air Conditioning, etc.).
When the agent submits this form, a new public property page is created at a URL like /listing/{property-id}, and it must be styled and structured to match the visual detail and data richness of the provided link.
Final Command:
Execute this entire, three-phase plan. The goal is a seamless, logical, and fully functional experience for both user types, culminating in a powerful and detailed property management system for paying agents.
