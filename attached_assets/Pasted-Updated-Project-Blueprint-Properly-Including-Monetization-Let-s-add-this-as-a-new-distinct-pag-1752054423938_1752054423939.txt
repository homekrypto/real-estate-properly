Underlying Functionality (The "Engine" for this Page):
This page is much more than just text. To make it work, we need a robust back-end system:
Payment Gateway Integration:
Clicking a Get Started button will initiate a checkout process. This requires integrating a secure payment provider like Stripe or PayPal.
The system will handle one-time annual payments and potentially recurring monthly subscriptions.
Subscription Management:
The Agent's user account in the database must be linked to their chosen subscription plan (Global 20, Global 50, etc.).
The system must track the subscription status (Active, Canceled, Past Due).
Feature Gating:
This is critical. The application must enforce the limits of each plan. An agent on the "Global 20" plan must be prevented from uploading their 21st listing. This logic will be built into the agent's property management dashboard.
Agent Sign-Up Flow:
The Sign Up process for an agent will now be different from a regular user. It will likely guide them to this pricing page to choose a plan as part of their onboarding.
Updated Development Roadmap
The addition of this monetization layer significantly impacts our roadmap. Here is the revised plan:
Phase 1: Back-End Foundation. (No change) Set up server and database schemas for Users, Properties, Agents. We will add a Subscriptions table.
Phase 2: User Authentication. (No change) Build the complete Sign Up, Login for standard users (property seekers).
Phase 3: Core Property Search. (No change) Populate the database with sample listings and build the search functionality so users can find properties.
Phase 4: Agent & Subscription Foundation.
Build the registration and profile pages for Agents.
Build the Pricing Page (visually).
Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe).
Develop the back-end subscription logic that links an Agent to a chosen plan upon successful payment.
Phase 5: Agent Functional Dashboard.
Build the dashboard where a logged-in agent can manage their properties.
Implement Feature Gating: Enforce the listing limits based on the agent's active subscription plan.
Phase 6: Content & Polish. Build the Blog, static pages, and conduct final testing.
